# 💊 Drug Side Effect Classification Model


A **Machine Learning project** developed during the **TCS iON Virtual Internship** in collaboration with **Amity University Online**.  
The model predicts the **severity of drug side effects** based on patient demographics and drug information.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project applies **data science and AI** to healthcare by building a classification model that identifies the **risk level of drug side effects**.  
It aims to support safer drug usage and assist medical researchers in **predictive pharmacology**.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
**Language:** Python  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Plotly  
**Platform:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Encoding & Feature Selection  
4. Model Building using:
   - Random Forest 🌲  
   - KNN 👥  
   - Gradient Boosting ⚡  
   - Logistic Regression 📈  
5. Model Evaluation & Visualization  

---

## ✅ Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest (highest accuracy & stability)  
- **Key Factors:** Age, Race, Drug Name  
- **Outcome:** Reliable prediction of side-effect severity  
- **Impact:** Enhances drug safety and supports medical decision-making
